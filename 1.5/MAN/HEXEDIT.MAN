  HEXEDIT file [position]

This external command allows you to
edit the contents of a file. With a
position specified, editing will start
from this position.

It'll display the position in the file,
the old value, and you may enter a new
value (hexadecimal), or just press
<RETURN> to leave it unchanged.

Press <ESC> to quit this command.
