  XFSIO.SYS n..|OFF

This resident command provides fast
SIO for the XF 551 disk drive. You
must enter drive numbers n of the
XF 551 drives.

The communication is 2.5 times faster
than the standard, but it may only
save some time when the disk is
formatted in the fast mode. See FORMAT
command.

The keyboard is disabled during fast
SIO operations to prevent problems.
