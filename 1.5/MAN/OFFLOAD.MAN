  OFFLOAD file [offset] [/L|Q]

This external command displays the
structure of a DOS loadable file. The
start and end address, and the file
position of each segment (after the
header) is displayed.

With the /L parameter it also loads
the file into memory, and with /Q it
asks you for each segment. When an
offset is specified, it will be added
to the load address of each segment.
