  LOAD file ..

Low Memory, Internal

This command will simply load a DOS
loadable file (program). Any init and
run address will be ignored.

The low memory version resides in the
memory area from $580-$6FF, so it is
not possible to load programs to this
area with the low memory version.

A list of parameters is not supported
by the internal version.
