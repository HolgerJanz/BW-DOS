  XBW15.DOS

The command processor of this version
of BW-DOS includes a set of basic
commands. The advantage is that they
do not have to be loaded from disk.

Integrated commands are:

BASIC, CAR, CD, DEL, DIR, DIRS, LOAD,
MD, PRINT, PROT, RD, REN, RUN, TYPE,
and UNPROT

External versions of this commands can
be called by absolute path e.g.,
D1:>DOS>DEL

The disadvantage is that MEMLO ($1EF0)
is higher then that of XBW15CP
and that less user memory is available.
