  IDEP2TD.SYS [/R]

This command installs a driver for a
hardware real time clock. It works with
the PBI device IDE plus 2.

Option /R installs a read-only version
which needs less memory.

If this driver is the first resident
program then a short driver is
installed, to save memory.

The last character in the status line
indicates the installed driver:
S - short read and write driver
M - read and write driver
s - short read driver
m - read driver
