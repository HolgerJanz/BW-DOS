  FORMAT [Dn:]

This command formats a disk and
installs BW-DOS. Formatting must be
the first thing done for a new disk.

The drive number specified as a
parameter is used for where to search
for the DOS files, not for which drive
the format should be performed on!

The program will ask you for necessary
input, and then format the disk. This
program cannot be controlled from a
batch file. Ramdisks cannot be
formatted in this way.

Besides the four standard formats
single, medium, double, and
double-side there are three more
options.

Reset File System: Clears disk. The
disk must already be formatted and
initialized with SpartaDOS file
system. This option is the fastest way
to clear a already used disk.

Create File System: Initializes
SpartaDOS file system. Prerequisite is
that the disk is already physically
formatted and the drive must support
the configuration block (Percom). This
option is used to initialize hard
disks.

Custom Configuration: Formats and
initializes the disk with SpartaDOS
file system using freely selectable
parameters. The drive must support the
configuration block. This option is
used for special formats supported by
drives like ATR8000, HDI, XF551 with
3,5â€œ modification, or 1050 Mini.
