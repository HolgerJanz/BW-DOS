  VERIFY ON|OFF

Low Memory

This external command switches the
write with verify option ON or OFF. The
default is OFF. With option ON every
sector is read after being written
internally in the drive and data is
compared. This results in a very slow
writing. It can be useful while using
bad quality disks.
