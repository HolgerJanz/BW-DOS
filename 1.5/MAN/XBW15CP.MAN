CP means "command processor only".

The advantage of this command
processor is the low MEMLO ($1D65).

The disadvantage is that there are
no integrated command.

All required commands have to be
provided on disk and it would be best
if they were made available in the
search path, usually the DOS directory
of the DOS drive. See command DOSDRIVE.
