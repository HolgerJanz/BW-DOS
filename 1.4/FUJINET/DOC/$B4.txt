$B4 	DIAGNOSTIC: Alter SIO Timing for T4
===================================================

Description

Alters the Timing value (in microseconds) for Timing value 4.

From the Atari Hardware Manual:

  The peripheral generates a delay (t4) between the transmission of 
    the last bit of the data frame and the receipt of the first bit 
    of the ACK byte by the computer. 

    computer t4 (min) = 850 microsec. 
    computer t4 (max) = 16 msec. 

    peripheral t4 (min) = ?? 
    peripheral t4 (max) = ??
