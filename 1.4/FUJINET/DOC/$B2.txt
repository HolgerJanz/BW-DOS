$B2 	DIAGNOSTIC: Alter SIO Timing for T2
===================================================

Description

Alters the Timing value (in microseconds) for Timing value 2.

From the Atari Hardware Manual:

  The peripheral generates a delay (t2) between the raising of 
    COMMAND- and the transmission of the ACK byte by the peripheral. 

    computer t2 (min) = O microsec. 
    computer t2 (max) = 16 msec. 

    peripheral t2 (min) = ?? 
    peripheral t2 (max) = ??
