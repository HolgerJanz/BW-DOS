$B3 	DIAGNOSTIC: Alter SIO Timing for T3
===================================================

Description

Alters the Timing value (in microseconds) for Timing value 3.

From the Atari Hardware Manual:

  The computer generates a delay (t3) between the receipt of the 
    last bit of the ACK byte and the transmission of the first bit of 
    the data frame by the computer. 

    computer t3 (min) = 1000 microsec. 
    computer t3 (max) = 1800 microsec. 

    peripheral t3 (min> = ?? 
    peripheral t3 <max> = ??
