$B5 	DIAGNOSTIC: Alter SIO Timing for T5
===================================================

Description

Alters the Timing value (in microseconds) for Timing value 4.

From the Atari Hardware Manual:

  The Peripheral generates a delay (t5) between the the receipt of 
    the last bit of the ACK byte and the first bit of the COMPLETE 
    byte by the computer. 

    computer t5 (min) = 250 microsec. 
    computer t5 (max) = 255 sec. (handler-dependent) 

    peripheral t5 (min) = ?? 
    peripheral t5 (max) = N/A
