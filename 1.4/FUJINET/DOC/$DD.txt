$DD 	Read App Key
===================================================

Description

After performing an Open App Key command with mode set to read, this command returns the contents of the app key, which may be up to MAX_APPKEY_LEN (64) bytes.

The actual return buffer is 66 bytes long to allow for two bytes that indicate the actual size of the key value:
Return buffer (66 bytes)

    2 bytes : length of actual key value in buffer
    64 bytes: buffer to contain max key value size (MAX_APPKEY_LEN)

The key file is closed immediately after the read operation is completed, so there's no need to call Close App Key (that function is saved for possible future use). Any other operations on the app key will require another Open App Key command.
