===================================================

Description

Alters the Timing value (in microseconds) for Timing value 1.

From the Atari Hardware Manual:

  The computer generates a delay (tl) between the transmission of 
    the last bit of the command frame and the raising of the COMMAND- line. 

    computer tl (min) = 650 microsec. 
    computer tl (max) = 950 microsec. 

    peripheral tl (min) = ?? 
    peripheral tl (max) = ??
