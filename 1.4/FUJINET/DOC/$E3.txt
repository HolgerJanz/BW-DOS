$E3 	Set HSIO Index
===================================================

Description

Changes the high speed SIO index value. Note that the Atari will likely need to be rebooted after this is changed, as most SIO routines only check which baud rate to use for high speed operation once. The FujiNet itself does not need to be rebooted, however.

DAUX1 provides the new index value while DAUX2 indicates whether or not to save this to the FujiNet configuration file.
