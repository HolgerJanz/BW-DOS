$B0 	DIAGNOSTIC: Alter SIO Timing for T0
===================================================

Description

Alters the Timing value (in microseconds) for Timing value 0.

From the Atari Hardware Manual:

  The computer generates a delay (tO) between the lowering of COMMAND-  
    and the transmission of the first byte of the command frame. 

    computer tO (min) = 750 microsec. 
    computer tO (max) = 1600 microsec. 

    peripheral tO (min) = ?? 
    peripheral tO (max) = ??
