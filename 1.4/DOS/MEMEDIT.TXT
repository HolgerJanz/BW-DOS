  MEMEDIT address

This external command allows you to
edit contents of memory. Use this only
if you know exactly, what you are
doing. It is possible to cause the
system to be corrupt, or even to lock
up with this command.

It'll display position, the old value,
and you can enter new value
(hexadecimal), or just press <RETURN>
to leave it unchanged. Press <ESC> to
quit this command.
