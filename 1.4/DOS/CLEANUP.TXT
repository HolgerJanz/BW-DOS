  CLEANUP Dn: [/P]

This program is a part of SpartaDOS
Toolkit, which was released as
ShareWare. With this program you can
fix several problems on BW-DOS disks.

Option P switches on the printer for
report of results.

The format of BW-DOS RamDisks may be
reported as bad by the CLEANUP program.
Unfortunately, this program contains a
bug. To prevent problems, you should
press <RESET> immediately after
leaving CLEANUP (under both BW-DOS and
SpartaDOS).
