  VERIFY ON|OFF

This external command switches the
write with verify option ON or OFF. The
default is OFF. With option ON every
sector is read after writing and
data are compared. This results in a
very slow writing. It can be useful
while using bad quality disks. 

Command requires 48k main memory.
