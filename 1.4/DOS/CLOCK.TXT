  CLOCK.SYS [ON|OFF]

This resident command is a software
clock for BW-DOS. If you've entered
the correct date/time (with DATE and
TIME commands), then every files and
directories will get the real time when
they are created.

This clock is based on the VBI
interrupt, so it is possible that a few
programs will stop it. It works on both
PAL and NTSC.

The parameter ON installs the clock and
OFF removes IT, if it was the last
driver loaded.

Command requires 48k main memory.
