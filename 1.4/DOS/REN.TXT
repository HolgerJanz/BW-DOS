}
  REN file filename

This command allows you to rename a
file specified by "file" parameter to
new name "filename". You can use wild
cards in both the names to rename a
set of files, and to leave specified
characters in the name unchanged.

For example when you have files
"TEST" and "BEST", after the command:

  REN ?EST ????S

you'll get files "TESTS" and "BESTS".

See RENDIR for renaming directories.
