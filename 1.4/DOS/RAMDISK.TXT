  RAMDISK.SYS (n[E][F] [file])|OFF

This resident command sets up an
emulated disk drive using extended
RAM, PORTB or Axlon up to 1MB.

The "n" parameter is the number of the
ramdisk drive.
The "F" option will cause the ramdisk
to be formatted.
The "E" option will cause that it will
not use 130XE compatible banks.
OFF removes the driver, if it was the
last driver loaded.

The configuration file can be used to
specify values for PORTB or Axlon to
be used for the ramdisk.
