  MENU [Dn:][/S(ENSD0)][/B(YN)][/Q(YN)]

This external command is a comfortable
tool for operations with many selected
files, for copying between two disks
with only one disk drive, and for
converting files from Atari DOS 2
format to BW-DOS and back.

"Dn:" specifies drive number the menu
will start with, and the rest is
similar to the "Setup" function:
/S is sorting of directories
/B is the bell function
/Q controls the question before
   overwriting a file.)

Command requires 48k main memory.
