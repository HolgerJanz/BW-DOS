  MOVE files [Dn:][path]

This command allows you to move a file
or subdirectory into another directory
on the same disk quickly. The
difference between COPY and MOVE is
that MOVE removes the file from source
directory, and is much faster. It also
doesn't need any free sectors on the
disk, because it only moves the
filename into an other directory,
without copying the file itself.

Command requires 48k main memory.
