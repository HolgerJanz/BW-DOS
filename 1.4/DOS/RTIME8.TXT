}
  RTIME8.SYS [/R]

This command installs a drivers for a
hardware real time clock. It works with
the R-Time-8 cartridge by ICD
(or other compatible one).

With the /R parameter a reduced version
will be installed. It allows only
reading from the clock, setting a new
date/time isn't possible in this mode.
This option saves memory.
