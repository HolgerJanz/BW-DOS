# BW-DOS 1.5

BW-DOS is a disk operating system for 8-bit ATARI computers with at
least 16kB RAM, and at least one disk drive. It is designed to be
compatible with SpartaDOS and to use as little memory as possible.
BW-DOS does not use extended RAM or the RAM under OS-ROM of XL/XE
machines, so it is compatible with software which uses these memory
spaces, such as the popular Turbo Basic, and others.

Highlights:
- can be started from cartridges supporting executables files
- comes with manual pages for every command
- two command processors, one without internal commands but low MEMLO
- configurable drive to search for external commands
- recursive COPY/DEL/SORTDIR commands
- powerful MOVE command to reorganize disks
- command FORMAT supports all known drives, including XF551 with 3.5 inch mod, 1050 Mini, ATR8000 etc.
- comes with MENU command for easy menu driven use
- comes with a handy text editor ED to edit batch files etc.
- powerful ramdisk RAMDISK.SYS supporting PORTB and Axlon extensions
