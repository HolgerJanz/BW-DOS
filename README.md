# BW-DOS

BW-DOS 1.3 is a disk operating system for 8-bit ATARI computers with at least 48kB RAM, and at least one disk drive. It is designed to be compatible with SpartaDOS, and to use as little memory as possible. The version 1.3 is the original version from 1995 by Jiri Bernasek (BEWESOFT) Na Hrebenkach 42 150 00 Praha 5 Czech Republic.

This repository is dedicated to provide source code for BW-DOS and its tools.

BW-DOS 1.4 is extended:

1. it works on all 8-bit ATARI with at least 16kB RAM (not yet for all commands)
2. contemporary command naming
3. help system with manual pages for all commands
4. extended tools

The version 1.4 is the version that will be maintained in the future.
